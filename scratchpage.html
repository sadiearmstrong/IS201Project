    <!-- introduction -->
    <p> A lot of people ask me "What are you planning on doing with music?" 
        Here is the honest answer: <div class= "boldMe">I have no idea!</div> <p></p> But, this is a from-scratch website that is basically a "brain dump" of me planning different ideas! Then, there is a link to a professional bootstrap website that is the beginning of me attempting to reach  my goals.

    <h4>What to Do With a Piano Performance Degree:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><div class = "ideaColors">TEACH</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Every parent wants their kid to learn musical skills, so this is a fairly safe option. You will almost never run out of students</li>
                <li> <span class = "emphasizeMe">PROs: </span> Help others develop a love for music, "pay it forward," and make a difference in your community</li>
                <li> <span class = "emphasizeMe">CONs: </span> I'm sure there are a lot of cons for this, but I honestly have no desire to teach other people. I tried it in the past and I don't like it. So, because this is just a brain dump of my options after this degree that is all I will include.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><div class = "ideaColors">GO ON TO GET A MASTERS/PHD</div>
            <ul>
                <li>I've noticed that in the piano world, at least for accompanying and performing classical music, people tend to "trust you" more if you have a Masters or a PHD. They think those degrees somehow make you automatically better at playing instruments. I don't really see the need for it though.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <div class = "ideaColors">GIGGING AND ACCOMPANYING</div>
            <ul>
                <li>There are so many things you can do with this, and I actually want to see how far I can go with it for the future! Some of the ideas:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pit Orchestra</li>
                        <li>Special events (weddings, funerals, parties, conferences, seminars, etc)</li>
                        <li>In-Studio musician</li>
                        <li>Play for bands</li>
                        <li>Play in the street</li>
                        <li>Accompany instrumentalists, vocalists, operas, musicals, etc</li>
                        <li>Basically anything you can think of</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><div class = "ideaColors">COMPOSE MUSIC- FILM SCORING, PERSONAL PORTFOLIO, ETC.</div>
            <ul>
                <li>This is something I have always wanted to do! It would take a lot of practice because I've never really composed anything for an orchestra before, but I would love to learn</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><div class = "ideaColors">CRUISE SHIP ENTERTAINER</div>
            <ul>
                <li> <span class = "emphasizeMe">PROs: </span> I would get to travel the world!!! Meet so many fun people, and get to practice performing/accompanying/whatever I end up doing on the cruise ship at a professional level</li>
                <li> <span class = "emphasizeMe">CONs: </span> This would be a hard life to live with a family. It would also be almost impossible to attend church and take the sacrament on a regular basis...</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><div class = "ideaColors">SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCER</div>
            <ul>
                <li>This is getting more and more popular, especially because when you write music you need other people to see it... and a good way to get them to see it is through social media. This honestly takes a lot of skills that I have not yet developed. I have no idea how to create good videos, I don't have the endurance or dilligence to post every single day (or at least very often). I will try this, but it will take time and effort. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><div class = "ideaColors">MUSIC INSTRUMENT REPAIR/TUNING</div>
            <ul>
                <li>I have already paid for my entire undergraduate degree and for my mission by doing this. I work as a piano tuner, cleaner, and technician. I have my own side job and I also work for the BYU piano shop, and it is so fun! It is also a job that A| not a lot of people can do, and B| pays a lot. And, it's fun! I get to meet a lot of cool people. I am going to continue to do this. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><div class = "ideaColors">PERFORM</div>
            <ul>
                <li>I mean, what else would you do with a degree in piano <span class= "boldMe"> performance</span>, right?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <div class = "ideaColors">SOUND TECHNICIAN OR AUDIO ENGINEER</div>
            <ul>
                <li>These skills are necessary if I want to work in recording studios, be able to create my own music, and not have to depend on other musicians. It is also something that I have always wanted to learn! I am taking an audio engineering class in the fall, I hope it jump-starts my learning curve that I will have to go through!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><div class = "ideaColors">QUIT PLAYING</div>
            <ul>
                <li>This is definitely the easiest option... but also, not an option. I've put too much work and time into this to stop now</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ol>

    <h4 class = "emphasizeMe" style= "text-align: center;">Sometimes, I get tired of practicing and want to quit.  That's when I need to find inspiration. <p></p> One of the first people who inspired me was Peter Bence. He is an incredible pianist, and his music is phenomenal and very unique! </h4>
